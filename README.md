#WorkManager
<h5>Implemented the WorkManager of Android Jetpack</h5>
<h5>WorkManager helps us to execute our tasks immediately or an appropriate time.</h5>
<h5>Earlier we had AlarmManager, JobScheduler, FirebaseJobDispatcher for scheduling the background tasks. But the issues were</h5>
<h6>JobScheduler – Available only for API >= 21 </h6>
<h6>FirebaseJobDispatcher – For backward compatibility</h6>
<h5>So developer had to understand which method to use when. To overcome these issue we have WorkManager, and it will automatically choose the best method for your task and you do not need to write logic for it.</h5>
